## Mobile App

_The Systers Portal is currently only available on the web. So one of the major ideas which would make the portal more accesible and versatile would be to launch the App on the Android Platform._

The following would be some of the features which would be looked for in the android app:

* A similar theme with that of the currently existing Portal website.
* OAuth Authentication using Github, Google, Facebook and Linkedin.
* Requesting and Creating Communities.
* Adding members and enable sharing and viewing of resources.
* Create Meetups - Both in-person and virtual.
* Personalized timeline.
* RSVP for Meetups.

Note: Another alternative to the android app could be a web app(Given the amount of work currently done on the Portal.)

## Personalized Dashboard/ Timeline for users

The Displayed home page of the portal currently contains details regarding the Systers Portal and the initiative of the portal. It would be be great if, after the login of the user, one is directed to a dashboard or timeline. The timeline would contain the following:

* The activity regarding the communities, resources and updates on the communities.
* Important meetups in or near the locations.
