# Resources and News

***Purpose of Need***

Now that the community is created and members can be added, the next step which comes up is the need to create resources and news and share them with the members of the community. There could have been a few ways it could have been done precisely:

* Create an Email Channel and Share information with All Members on the Channel.
* Provide an Option to Create and Add Resources News and Topics on the Portal itself.

The Second Option was chosen because of the following reasons.

- To keep the Communities and its operations at one place as it would be easy to manage
- To extend the use of the Portal, so that it would not just be a one time visit to the website.

## The Following Features are Provided by the Portal for Sharing Resources and News.

- Resources can be created by members and moderators
- The Resources which are moderated by the admins or moderators are visible publicly to all the people
- The user can create pages on the community on various topics of discussions.
- Various Tags can be added to resources and news so that people can easily access them.
- News Regarding the Community can be shared on the Community Landing Page
- Discussion Section where people can discuss over particular topics or issues
