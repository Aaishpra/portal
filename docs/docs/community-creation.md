# Communities

_As the Mission Statement of the Portal states "Systers is an international community for all women involved in the technical aspects of computing. We welcome the participation of women technologists of all ages and at any stage of their studies or careers.", there exists communities, which can be requested for and created,which allows engagement of women to get together on both, a large scale and small scale basis_

## The Concept of Community Creation

***Search for Communities:***

- Anyone who visits the website can browse for communities without being logged in.
- On browsing, if the user finds a suitable location nearby and wishes to get more details may visit the community page.
- The community page consists of the following details:
    - News Regarding the community
    - Resources shared in the community

***Joining a community:***

- If a person wishes to be a part of a particular community, one has to be a user/registered member of the Systers Portal.
- Once the person is a registered, one can make a request to join a particular community.
- On making the request, the admin for the Portal or a Moderator of a Particular Community will approve or reject the request.
- On approval the user becomes a part of the community and can now share resources and stuff.

***Requesting a community:***

- If a user does not find a community to join nearby, then he/she has the option to request for a new community.
- The details for the community would be asked by the Admin in a form.
- After the Form for Creating a community is accepted by the Admin or any staff, then the community is created.
- The person who had requested the community becomes a community moderator and has the following priviledges:
    - Add members to the Community
    - Add Community News
    - Add more Moderators to the Community
