First of all, thank you for the interest in contributing to the Portal!

Any issue labeled as [Status: Available](https://github.com/anitab-org/portal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Status%3A+Available%22) or [First Timers Only](https://github.com/anitab-org/portal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22First+Timers+Only%22) can be worked by any contributor.

Issues labeled as `First Timers Only` are more oriented towards newcomers, with the exception of Quality Assurance issues that can be worked by any contributor because there can always be some bug and these issues are always available.


There are many ways you can contribute to this project.

* **Test Portal for Quality Assurance** purposes and **report bugs** (if any);
* **Give feedback** on what is shared with the community (UI prototype, suggesting new features);
* **Participate in discussions** on Slack;
* **Solving the available issues**, implement features, fix bugs, develop tests, etc...;
* **Helping others** understand the project **on Slack**;
* Review pull requests (PRs), even if you're a newcomer.


## Code
You can help on the development. You can check the contribution guidelines for this, `CONTRIBUTING.md` file inside `.github` folder.

Before starting to contribute make sure to check our [Commit Message Style Guide](https://github.com/anitab-org/portal/wiki/Commit-Message-Style-Guide).

You can filter also issues with labels such as [Category: Coding](https://github.com/anitab-org/portal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Category%3A+Coding%22+) which are available [Status: Available](https://github.com/anitab-org/portal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Status%3A+Available%22).

You can find a bugs while testing and submit an issue to solve them.

## Quality Assurance

You can test Portal for bugs.
If you find any bug you can report by creating an issue, using the Bug report template. These types of reports are very important because we can detect bugs in the portal and then create issues that fix these bugs. Also if you're not comfortable with the code you can just report a bugs you find, without having to suggest a solution on it, and that's a valuable contribution to the project.

## Documentation

Documentation is a very important part of Open Source. These is what new contributors use to learn about the project before starting to contribute. You can always suggest improvements on the existing documentation and even help developing it.
