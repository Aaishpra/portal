The Concept of Meetups
======================

_Meetups were created as a later addition to the original systers portal project because of the need to organise events within the Portal Communities_

***Requesting Meetups***

* Any user of the portal i.e registered within the portal can request for meetups
* Meetup Requests require a few fields to be filled in by the users so that the request can be reviewed. They are
    * Title for Meetup
    * Venue
    * Location
    * Date
    * Time
    * Description
    * Resources and Images
* The Request is then reviewed by the staff and will be accepted or rejected.
* If accepted, the user who requested for the meetup to be created will become the leader for the meetup
* The Leader can edit meetup details and approve or reject support requests.

***Support Requests***

* Meetups may require support from volunteers for perfect organisation of any meetup
* Users can checkout the details for a particular meetup and then add a support request.
* The request would be approved or rejected by the leader.
