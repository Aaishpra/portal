## Mission
Systers is an international community for all women involved in the technical aspects of computing. We welcome the participation of women technologists of all ages and at any stage of their studies or careers.

We engage our community by contributing to open source, collaborating with the global community, and learning/enhancing our coding skills.  We are committed to providing a safe, positive online community for our many volunteers that offer their skills, time, and commitment to our projects.

In order to engage with the community, you can sign up on Zulip.

## Code of Conduct
A primary goal of Systers is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

See the full [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/systers/portal/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md) and the [Reporting Guidelines](https://github.com/systers/portal/blob/master/reporting_guidelines.md).
